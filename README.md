# Spatial_Telcom_Voice_Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the voice call quality customer experience across three major Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) in India: IDEA, AIRTEL, and RJIO for the year 2020.

## Introduction
Voice calling is a fundamental mode of communication, allowing real-time conversations and providing insight into emotions and context. This project aims to assess the quality of voice calls provided by different TSPs based on customer feedback data.

## Data Sources
The primary data sources for this analysis include:
1. [Voice Call Quality Customer Experience Data 2020](https://data.gov.in/catalog/voice-call-quality-customer-experience?page=1#)
2. [Indian State Shapefile](https://geographicalanalysis.com/download-free-india-shapefile-including-kashmir-and-ladakh/)

## Data Wrangling
The data underwent several preprocessing steps, including cleaning, filtering, and transformation. This involved handling missing values, filtering relevant columns, and organizing the data for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the voice call quality across different dimensions:
- Call Quality Rating
- Call Quality Experience
- Number of Customer Feedback
- Comparison of Voice Call Quality Across TSPs
- Voice Call Quality Rating Throughout Year 2020
- Call Quality Rating State Wise

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, TSP IDEA emerged as the leader in providing satisfactory voice call quality, while AIRTEL showed areas for improvement. RJIO maintained consistent performance. This analysis provides valuable insights into customer experience and can guide strategic decisions for telecom service providers.
